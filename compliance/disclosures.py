EQUAL CREDIT OPPORTUNITY ACT NOTICE

The Federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibits creditors from
discriminating against credit applicants on the basis of race, color,
religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age (provided the applicant
has the capacity to enter into a binding contract); because all or part of
the applicant's income derives from any public assistance program; or
because the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the
Consumer Credit Protection Act.

The federal agency that administers compliance with this law concerning
this creditor is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 1700 G Street NW,
Washington, DC 20552.

FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT NOTICE

In connection with your application for credit, we may obtain a consumer
report from one or more consumer reporting agencies. If we take adverse
action based in whole or in part on information contained in such a report,
we will provide you with the name, address, and telephone number of the
consumer reporting agency that furnished the report, a statement that the
agency did not make the credit decision and is unable to provide the
specific reasons for the adverse action, and a notice of your right to
obtain a free copy of the report and to dispute inaccurate information.

You have the right under the FCRA to know the information contained in
your file at the consumer reporting agency. You also have the right to
dispute any inaccurate information.
