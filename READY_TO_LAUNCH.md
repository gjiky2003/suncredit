### How to run
```bash
cd ~/suncredit/platform
python3 app.py        # serves on http://127.0.0.1:8086
# Admin: admin@suncredit.com / change-me-now
```

## 2. ✅ Tested Flows (Automated)

- Landing → Register → Dashboard → Apply (5 steps) → Decision rendered
- Logout → Login → Dashboard
- Connect-bank stub
- Admin login → Dashboard / Applications / Borrowers / Portfolio
- Underwriting scorer end-to-end
- Cash-flow scoring
- bcrypt password hashing
- Auth-gated API routes

---

## 3. ✅ Security Audit (Static)

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `eval`/`exec` use | ✓ Clean |
| `shell=True` | ✓ Clean |
| SQL injection (f-string SQL) | ✓ Clean (parametrized queries throughout) |
| SSTI (`render_template_string`) | ✓ Clean |
| Debug mode | ✓ Off |
| Hardcoded short secrets | ✓ Clean |
| JWT timezone bug | ✓ Fixed (UTC-aware) |
| Password storage | ✓ bcrypt |

See `launch/SECURITY_AUDIT.md` for details and recommended hardening before public launch (rate limiting, CSRF tokens, HSTS, etc.).

## 5. ⏳ Human-Only Steps Before You Take Real Money

**These cannot be automated. Do them in order:**

### Phase 1 — Legal foundation (Week 1–2)
1. ☐ Hire a **consumer-finance attorney** ($3k–$10k retainer). Non-negotiable.
2. ☐ File LLC in your home state (`OPERATING_AGREEMENT.md` as template).
3. ☐ Get EIN from IRS (free, 10 min online).
4. ☐ Open business bank account (Mercury / Brex for speed).
5. ☐ Buy domain (`suncredit.com` if available) — see `DOMAIN_SETUP.md`.

### Phase 2 — Compliance (Week 2–6)
6. ☐ Decide your model: **direct lender** (need state licenses) vs **bank partnership** (rent a bank's charter — much faster).
7. ☐ If direct: apply for licenses in 1–3 launch states (TX guide as model).
8. ☐ Get surety bonds via broker (`SURETY_BOND_GUIDE.md`).
9. ☐ Adopt BSA/AML written policy (`COMPLIANCE_MANUAL_OUTLINE.md`).
10. ☐ Designate a Compliance Officer (you, until you can hire).

### Phase 3 — Vendors (Week 4–8)
11. ☐ Sign with **Persona** or **Alloy** for KYC ($1–$3 per check).
12. ☐ Sign with **Plaid** for bank linking ($0.30–$0.90 per link).
13. ☐ Sign with **Stripe Treasury** OR a sponsor bank for ACH/disbursement.
14. ☐ Sign with a **credit bureau** (Experian/TransUnion/Equifax — one is enough to start).
15. ☐ Add real API keys to environment variables.

### Phase 4 — Capital (parallel to Phase 2–3)
16. ☐ Decide funding source: **own capital** (fastest) vs **debt warehouse** vs **equity raise** (PPM ready).
17. ☐ For first 10 pilot loans you only need **$50k–$100k** — self-fund if possible.

### Phase 5 — Launch Pilot (Week 8–10)
18. ☐ Run 10 friends-and-family loans following `PILOT_LOANS_GUIDE.md`.
19. ☐ Track every loan in `PILOT_PORTFOLIO_TRACKER.csv`.
20. ☐ Iterate on underwriting model with real data.

### Phase 6 — Public Launch (Week 10+)
21. ☐ Add rate limiting (Flask-Limiter), CSRF protection (Flask-WTF), HTTPS (Let's Encrypt).
22. ☐ Move from SQLite → Postgres.
23. ☐ Deploy to a real host (Render / Fly.io / AWS).
24. ☐ Get a SOC 2 Type 1 attestation if pursuing institutional capital.
25. ☐ Marketing — content, partnerships, paid acquisition.

## 6. 🚨 Hard Truths

- **You cannot legally lend money to strangers in the US without state licenses or a bank partner.** Period. The platform is ready; the legal stack is the bottleneck.
- **Budget realistically:** $25k–$75k in legal/licensing/bonding to launch in 1–3 states. Bank-partnership model can lower this to ~$15k.
- **Timeline realistically:** 2–6 months to first legal loan. Most of that is waiting on regulators, not coding.
- **The ML model is trained on synthetic data.** Retrain on the first 100+ real loans before scaling.

## 7. Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Run platform
cd ~/suncredit/platform && python3 app.py

# Run all tests
cd ~/suncredit && python3 test_e2e.py

# Train model on fresh synthetic data
cd ~/suncredit && python3 -m underwriting.train

# Score a hypothetical applicant
python3 -c "from underwriting.scorer import score; print(score({'credit_score':720,'annual_income':75000,'loan_amount':10000,'term_months':36,'employment_status':'full_time','dti_ratio':0.28,'prior_defaults':0}))"
```
